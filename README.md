# How to use the Triton tutorial Codespace

1. Go to https://github.com/codespaces (you must have a Github account and sign in)
2. Click **New Codespace**
3. For **Repository**, type in and select **bmyerz0/triton-cpu-emulation**
4. For all other options, leave them as the defaults
5. The first time you open the Codespace, you will need to wait a few moments for installation (seen in **TERMINAL** tab) to finish. It will say **Running updateContentCommand...** while busy. Once finished, the **TERMINAL** tab has a shell promt.
6. Open the notebooks in the notebooks folder.
7. The first time you **Run All** in a notebook with Python code (softmax.ipynb), you'll need to select a kernel. Choose **Python Environments...** then **Python 3.10.8**.

## Tips

The Codespace uses free tier time on Azure.
When you are not using the Codespace, go to https://github.com/codespaces and stop it.

# Just view the notebook without running it
